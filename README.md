Copying the site wasn't so hard when done with proper planning. It didn't require deep learning of web development and only consisted of HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript. First, I looked at the original website and sketched the layout in a notebook. Then, I used a grid to create the overall layout. In around 20-30 minutes, the initial layout was ready, but the margins, padding, spaces, and sizes needed correction. So, I opened both the original and my website side by side and began adjusting values through trial and error to match the original.

Finding a similar font for my website was tiresome. I found a site that could search for fonts on the internet by screenshot, but all the fonts it found were paid ones. Then, I went to Google Fonts and found nearly similar fonts. The only challenging thing I faced while making this website was flipping the images, which was also tiring. I tried applying 10-15 types of flipping transitions, but none looked like what was needed. However, through this process, I discovered many other different transition effects, one where on hover, the image kept rotating like a fan. It took me around 30 minutes to apply a similar transition effect. The entire process of making the site took around 2 hours.
